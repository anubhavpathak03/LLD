## SOLID Principles 
- S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- O: Open-Close Principle (OCP)
- L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

-> A class should have only one reason to change.

-> A class should do only one thing 

means goal is that one Class handle one Responsibility only at time


## 2️⃣ Open-Close Principle (OCP)

## 4️⃣ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

## 5️⃣ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
